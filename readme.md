Imagine the situation. You're a long way away from the foos table, but
you still want to know the state of play. Fortunately you've got a Mac
with Growl installed. Run `growl_foos.sh` to check
foosaholics.herokuapp.com for new games. If anything exciting has
happened since you last ran the script you'll know all about it. Run
every minute for maximum benefit.
